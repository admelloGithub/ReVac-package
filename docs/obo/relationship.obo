remark: <p>This ontology contains logical relations to be shared across the different OBO ontologies. Each OBO ontology is free to extend this set with relations specific to the biology within that ontology. This ontology should remain largely invisible to the casual user</p><p>This ontology is designed to be used by the following groups of people: <dl><dt>OBO curators</dt><dd>each OBO ontology should use relations that are consistent with the relations defined here</dd><dt>Database administrators and developers, and other software developers</dt><dd>This ontology file is a partial computable specification of the core relationships in OBO. (The full semantics can not be specified using the OBO format, please refer to the paper for a full specification). This obo format file can be loaded into a database such as GO-DB or Chado in order to make relations between classes and instance data interoperable </dd><dt>Advanced users</dt><dd>The formal relations specified here allow for formal reasoning over the ontologies in OBO</dd></dl><h3>Notes:</h3><p>In the above, variables c, d, ..., p, q, ... range over instances of continuants and processes respectively.
