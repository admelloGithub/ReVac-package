comment: -!- While all enzymes of this family oxidize the (S)-enantiomer of an alpha-hydroxy acid to an alpha-oxo acid, the ultimate oxidant (oxygen, intramolecular heme or some other acceptor) depends on the particular enzyme. -!- Transfers the electron pair from FMNH(2) to a component of the electron transport chain, most probably ubiquinone. -!- It is part of a metabolic pathway in Pseudomonads that allows these organisms to utilize mandelic acid, derivatized from the common soil metabolite amygdalin, as the sole source of carbon and energy. -!- Has a large active-site pocket and preferentially binds substrates with longer sidechains, e.g. 2-hydroxyoctanoate rather than 2-hydroxybutyrate. -!- It also prefers substrates that, like (S)-mandelate, have beta unsaturation, e.g. (indol-3-yl)glycolate compared with (indol-3- yl)lactate. -!- Esters of mandelate, such as methyl (S)-mandelate, are also substrates.

def: "Primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite + NADP(+) = red chlorophyll catabolite + NADPH." []
comment: -!- Chlorophyll degradation is a characteristic symptom of leaf senescence and fruit ripening. -!- The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme requires reduced ferredoxin, which is generated either by NADPH through the pentose-phosphate pathway or by the action of photosystem I. -!- This reaction takes place without release of the substrate from EC 1.14.12.20. -!- Depending on the plant species used as the source of enzyme, one of two possible C-1 epimers of primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (pFCC), pFCC-1 or pFCC-2, is normally formed, with all genera or species within a family producing the same isomer. -!- After modification and export, pFCCs are eventually imported into the vacuole, where the acidic environment causes their non-enzymic conversion into colorless breakdown products called non-fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs).

comment: -!- Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant proteins. -!- They can be divided into three classes: typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys and 1-Cys peroxiredoxins. -!- The peroxidase reaction comprises two steps centered around a redox- active cysteine called the peroxidatic cysteine. -!- All three peroxiredoxin classes have the first step in common, in which the peroxidatic cysteine attacks the peroxide substrate and is oxidized to S-hydroxycysteine (a sulfenic acid). -!- The second step of the peroxidase reaction, the regeneration of cysteine from S-hydroxycysteine, distinguishes the three peroxiredoxin classes. -!- For typical 2-Cys Prxs, in the second step, the peroxidatic S-hydroxycysteine from one subunit is attacked by the 'resolving' cysteine located in the C-terminus of the second subunit, to form an intersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of several cell-specific thiol-containing reductants (R'-SH) (e.g. thioredoxin, AhpF, tryparedoxin or AhpD), completing the catalytic cycle. -!- In the atypical 2-Cys Prxs, both the peroxidatic cysteine and its resolving cysteine are in the same polypeptide, so their reaction forms an intrachain disulfide bond. -!- To recycle the disulfide, known atypical 2-Cys Prxs appear to use thioredoxin as an electron donor. -!- The 1-Cys Prxs conserve only the peroxidatic cysteine, so that its oxidized form is directly reduced to cysteine by the reductant molecule.

comment: -!- The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II). -!- Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalyzed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. -!- For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and EC 1.16.1.8. -!- In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and EC 1.18.1.2). -!- Acts on the monoglutamate as well as the triglutamate folate, in contrast with EC 2.1.1.14, which acts only on the triglutamate.

comment: -!- This enzyme is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis. -!- Ubiquinones from different organisms have a different number of prenyl units (for example, ubiquinone-6 in Saccharomyces, ubiquinone- 9 in rat and ubiquinone-10 in human), and thus the natural substrate for the enzymes from different organisms has a different number of prenyl units. -!- However, the enzyme usually shows a low degree of specificity regarding the number of prenyl units. -!- For example, when the COQ5 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is introduced into Escherichia coli, it complements the respiratory deficiency of an ubiE mutant. -!- The bifunctional enzyme from E.coli also catalyzes the methylation of demethylmenaquinol-8 (this activity is classified as EC 2.1.1.163).

comment: -!- The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for complete 5-methylcytosine methylations of yeast tRNA. -!- The incidence of modification depends on the cytosine position in tRNA. -!- At positions 34 and 40, 5-methylcytosine is found only in two yeast tRNAs (tRNA(Leu)(CUA) and tRNA(Phe)(GAA), respectively), whereas most other elongator yeast tRNAs bear either 5-methylcytosine(48) or 5-methylcytosine(49), but never both in the same tRNA molecule. -!- The formation of 5-methylcytosine(34) and 5-methylcytosine(40) is a strictly intron-dependent process, whereas the formation of 5-methylcytosine(48) and 5-methylcytosine(49) is an intron- independent process. -!- Formerly EC 2.1.1.29.

comment: -!- Responsible for the chain-elongation step of dissociated (type II) fatty-acid biosynthesis, i.e. the addition of two C atoms to the fatty-acid chain. -!- Escherichia coli mutants that lack this enzyme are deficient in unsaturated fatty acids. -!- Can use fatty acyl thioesters of ACP (C(2) to C(16)) as substrates, as well as fatty acyl thioesters of Co-A (C(4) to C(16)). -!- The substrate specificity is very similar to that of EC 2.3.1.179 with the exception that the latter enzyme is far more active with palmitoleoyl-ACP (C(16)-Delta(9)) as substrate, allowing the organism to regulate its fatty-acid composition with changes in temperature.

comment: -!- This enzyme differs from EC 2.3.1.20 by synthesising triacylglycerol using an acyl-CoA-independent mechanism. -!- The specificity of the enzyme for the acyl group in the phospholipid varies with species, e.g., the enzyme from castor bean (Ricinus communis) preferentially incorporates vernoloyl (12,13-epoxyoctadec- 9-enoyl) groups into triacylglycerol, whereas that from the hawk's beard (Crepis palaestina) incorporates both ricinoleoyl (12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoyl) and vernoloyl groups. -!- The enzyme from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae specifically transfers acyl groups from the sn-2 position of the phospholipid to diacylglycerol, thus forming an sn-1-lysophospholipid.

comment: -!- The first reaction of this enzyme is to catalyze its own glucosylation, normally at a specific Tyr of the protein if this group is free; when the Tyr is replaced by Thr or Phe, the enzyme's self-glucosylation activity is lost but its intermolecular transglucosylation ability remains. -!- It continues to glucosylate an existing glucosyl group until a length of about 5-13 residues has been formed. -!- Further lengthening of the glycogen chain is then carried out by EC 2.4.1.11. -!- Not highly specific for the donor, using UDP-xylose in addition to UDP-glucose (although not glucosylating or xylosylating a xylosyl group so added). -!- It can also use CDP-glucose and TDP-glucose, but not ADP-glucose or GDP-glucose. -!- Similarly it is not highly specific for the acceptor, using water (i.e. hydrolyzing UDP-glucose) among others. -!- Various forms of the enzyme exist, and different forms predominate in different organs. -!- Thus primate liver contains glycogenin-2, of molecular mass 66 kDa, whereas the more widespread form is glycogenin-1, with a molecular mass of 38 kDa. -!- Formerly EC 2.4.1.112.

comment: -!- Specific for (1->6)-alpha-D-glucans (dextrans) and, unlike cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.19), without activity toward (1->4)-alpha-D-glucans, such as amylose. -!- It also has no activity on oligosaccharides, such as amylopectin and pullulan, containing (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages at branch points. -!- The enzyme from Bacillus circulans T-3040 has been shown to form cycloisomalto-oligosaccharides of three sizes (7, 8 and 9 glucose units). -!- It will also catalyze the disproportionation of two isomalto- oligosaccharides molecules to yield a series of isomalto- oligosachharides and the addition of D-glucose to cycloisomalto- oligosaccharides with ring opening to form isomalto-oligosaccharides.

comment: -!- The corrinoid adenosylation pathway comprises three steps: (1) Reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) by a one-electron transfer; this can be carried out by EC 1.16.1.3, or non-enzymically in the presence of dihydroflavin nucleotides. (2) Co(II) is reduced to Co(I) in a second single-electron transfer by EC 1.16.1.4. (3) The Co(I) conducts a nucleophilic attack on the adenosyl moiety of ATP to leave the cobalt atom in a Co(III) state (EC 2.5.1.17). -!- The enzyme responsible for the adenosylation reaction is the product of the gene cobO in the aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas denitrificans and of the gene cobA in the anaerobic bacterium Salmonella typhimurium. -!- In P.denitrificans, the enzyme shows specificity for cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide and the corrinoids that occur later in the biosynthetic pathway whereas CobA seems to have broader specificity. -!- While CobA has a preference for ATP and Mn(2+), it is able to transfer a variety of nucleosides to the cobalt, including CTP, UTP and GTP, in decreasing order of preference and to use Mg(2+) instead of Mn(2+).

comment: -!- The cofactors FMN and FAD participate in numerous processes in all organisms, including mitochondrial electron transport, photosynthesis, fatty-acid oxidation, and metabolism of vitamin B(6), vitamin B12 and folates. -!- While monofunctional riboflavin kinase is found in eukaryotes, some bacteria have a bifunctional enzyme that exhibits both this activity and that of EC 2.7.7.2. -!- In Bacillus subtilis, ATP can be replaced by other phosphate donors but with decreasing enzyme activity in the order ATP > dATP > CTP > UTP.

comment: -!- All polyketide synthases, fatty-acid synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases require post-translational modification of their constituent acyl-carrier-protein (ACP) domains to become catalytically active. -!- The inactive apo-proteins are converted into their active holo-forms by transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of CoA to the sidechain hydroxy group of a conserved serine residue in each ACP domain. -!- The enzyme from human can activate both the ACP domain of the human cytosolic multifunctional fatty acid synthase and that associated with human mitochondria as well as peptidyl-carrier and acyl-carrier- proteins from prokaryotes. -!- Removal of the 4-phosphopantetheinyl moiety from holo-ACP is carried out by EC 3.1.4.14.

comment: -!- This enzyme sulfates the residues marked with an asterisk in sequences containing at least ->IdoA2S->GlcN*-> or ->GlcA2S->GlcN*->. -!- Preference for GlcN2S versus unmodified GlcN has not yet been established. -!- Additional structural features are presumably required for substrate recognition, since the 3-O-sulfated residue is of low abundance, whereas the above IdoA-containing sequence is quite abundant. -!- This enzyme differs from the other [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferases by modifying selected glucosamine residues preceded by GlcA2S; EC 2.8.2.23 prefers GlcA or IdoA, whereas EC 2.8.2.30 prefers IdoA2S.

comment: -!- Fluoroacetate is extremely toxic. -!- It reacts with CoA to form fluoroacetyl-CoA, which substitutes for acetyl CoA and reacts with EC 2.3.3.1 to produce fluorocitrate, a metabolite of which binds very tightly to EC 4.2.1.3 and halts the TCA cycle. -!- This enzyme hydrolyzes fluoroacetyl-CoA before it can react with citrate synthase, and thus confers fluoroacetate resistance on the organisms that produce it. -!- It has been described in the poisonous plant Dichapetalum cymosum and the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya, both of which are fluoroacetate producers.

comment: -!- This enzyme is also active when O-4 of the glucosamine is substituted by carrying the oligosaccharide that can link a protein to the structure. -!- It therefore cleaves proteins from the lipid part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, but does so by hydrolysis, whereas EC 4.6.1.14 does so by elimination. -!- It acts on plasma membranes only after solubilization of the substrate with detergents or solvents, but it may act on intracellular membranes.

comment: -!- RNase E is a bacterial ribonuclease that plays a role in the processing of ribosomal RNA (9S to 5S rRNA), the chemical degradation of bulk cellular RNA, the decay of specific regulatory, messenger and structural RNAs and the control of plasmid DNA replication. -!- The enzyme binds to monophosphorylated 5' ends of substrates but exhibits sequential cleavages in the 3' to 5' direction. -!- 2'-O-Methyl nucleotide substitutions at RNase E binding sites do not prevent binding but do prevent cleavage of non-modified target sequences 5' to that locus. -!- In Escherichia coli, the enzyme is found in the RNA degradosome. -!- The C-terminal half of the protein contains binding sites for the three other major degradosomal components, the DEAD-box RNA helicase Rh1B, EC 4.1.1.11 and EC 2.7.7.8. -!- Formerly EC 3.1.26.n1.

comment: -!- In the equine arterivirus (EAV), the replicase gene is translated into open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1ab polyproteins. -!- This enzyme is the main viral proteinase and processes five cleavage sites in the ORF1a protein and three in the ORF1b-encoded part of the ORF1ab protein to yield nonstructural proteins (nsp5-nsp12). -!- It combines the catalytic system of a chymotrypsin-like serine peptidase (His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad) with the substrate specificity of a 3C-like serine peptidase (Glu or Gln) at the P1 position and a small amino-acid residue (Gly, Ser or Ala) at the P1' position. -!- Cleavage of ORF1ab by this enzyme is essential for viral replication. -!- Belongs to peptidase family S32.

comment: -!- Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a birnavirus that causes an acute, contagious disease in young salmonid fish. -!- As with most viruses that infect eukaryotic cells, the proteolytic processing of viral precursor proteins is a crucial step in the life cycle of this virus. -!- pVP2 is converted into VP2 by cleavage near the carboxy end of pVP2; this cleavage is most likely due to host-cell proteases rather than VP4. -!- Differs from most serine peptidases in not having the catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp. -!- Belongs to peptidase family S50.

def: "Self-cleaves 52-Val-|-Asn-53, 62-Ala-|-Phe-63 and 74-Val-|-Thr-75 at the N-terminus of SpoIVB." []
comment: -!- This enzyme plays a central role in a regulatory checkpoint (the sigma(K) checkpoint), which coordinates gene expression during the later stages of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis. -!- The enzyme activates proteolytic processing of a sporulation-specific sigma factor, pro-sigma(K), to its mature and active form, sigma(K), by self-cleavage. -!- The enzyme is also subject to secondary proteolysis, which presumably inactivates SpoIVB. -!- The enzyme is also essential for the formation of heat-resistant spores. -!- Belongs to peptidase family S55.

comment: -!- Caspase-10 is an initiator caspase, as are caspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55), caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61) and caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62). -!- Like caspase-8, it contains two tandem death effector domains (DEDs) in its N-terminal prodomain, which play a role in procaspase activation. -!- Has many overlapping substrates in common with caspase-8, such as RIP (the cleavage of which impairs NF-kappa-B survival signaling and starts the cell-death process) and PAK2 (associated with some of the morphological features of apoptosis, such as cell rounding and apoptotic body formation). -!- Bid, a Bcl2 protein, can be cleaved by caspase-3 (EC 3.4.22.56), caspase-8 and caspase-10 at Lys-Gln-Thr-Asp-|- to yield the pro- apoptotic p15 fragment. -!- The p15 fragment is N-myristoylated and enhances cytochrome c release from mitochondria (which initiatiates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway). -!- Bid can be further cleaved by caspase-10 and granzyme B but not by caspase-3 and caspase-8 at Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-|- to yield a p13 fragment that is not N-myristoylated. -!- Belongs to peptidase family C14.

comment: -!- Part of the family of inflammatory-caspases, which also includes caspase-1 (EC 3.4.22.36), caspase-4 (EC 3.4.22.57) and caspase-5 (EC 3.4.22.58) in humans and caspase-12, caspase-13 and caspase-14 in mice. -!- Contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) in its N-terminal prodomain, which plays a role in procaspase activation. -!- Like caspase-5, but unlike caspase-4, this enzyme can be induced by lipopolysaccharide. -!- Not only activates caspase-1, which is required for the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) and IL-18, but it also activates caspase-3 (EC 3.4.22.56), which leads to cellular apoptosis under pathological conditions. -!- Belongs to peptidase family C14.

comment: -!- This enzyme, derived from the house dust mite, is a major component of the allergic immune response. -!- The substrate specificity of this enzyme is not altogether clear; it cleaves the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23 at 298-Glu-|-Ser-299 and 155-Ser-|-Ser-156. -!- It also cleaves the pulmonary structural proteins occludin and claudin at Leu-|-Leu, Asp-|-Leu and at Gly-|-Thr bonds, and it can also cleave the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (CD25). -!- Using a positional scanning combinatorial library, it was found that the major substrate-specificity determinant is for Ala in the P2 position. -!- The enzyme shows only a slight preference for basic amino acids in the P1 and P3 positions and a preference for aliphatic amino acids such as Ile, Pro, Val, Leu and norleucine in the P4 position. -!- Belongs to peptidase family C1.

comment: -!- Viruses that are members of the Norovirus genus (Caliciviridae family) are a major cause of epidemic acute viral gastroenteritis. -!- The nonstructural proteins of these viruses are produced by proteolytic cleavage of a large precursor polyprotein, performed by a protease that is incorporated into the polyprotein. -!- Cleavage sites are apparently defined by features based on both sequence and structure since several sites in the polyprotein fulfilling the identified sequence requirements are not cleaved. -!- The presence of acidic (Asp), basic (Arg), aromatic (Tyr) or aliphatic (Leu) amino acids at the P1' position results in only minor differences in cleavage efficiency, suggesting that steric or conformational constraints may play a role in determining specificity. -!- Changes to the amino acid at the P2 position do not alter cleavage efficiency. -!- Belongs to peptidase family C37.

comment: -!- Two types of malonate decarboxylase are currently known, both of which form multienzyme complexes. -!- This enzyme is a cytosolic protein that is biotin-independent. -!- The other type is a biotin-dependent, Na(+)-translocating enzyme that includes both soluble and membrane-bound components (cf. EC 4.1.1.89). -!- As free malonate is chemically rather inert, it has to be activated prior to decarboxylation. -!- In both enzymes, this is achieved by exchanging malonate with an acetyl group bound to an acyl-carrier protiein (ACP), to form malonyl-ACP and acetate, with subsequent decarboxylation regenerating the acetyl-ACP. -!- The ACP subunit of both enzymes differs from that found in fatty-acid biosynthesis by having phosphopantethine attached to a serine side- chain as 2'-(5-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA rather than as phosphopantetheine 4'-phosphate. -!- The individual enzymes involved in carrying out the reaction of this enzyme complex are EC 2.3.1.187, EC 2.3.1.39 and EC 4.1.1.87. -!- The carboxy group is lost with retention of configuration.

comment: -!- This enzyme is also active when O-4 of the glucosamine is substituted by carrying the oligosaccharide that can link a protein to the structure. -!- It therefore cleaves proteins from the lipid part of the glycosylphostphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. -!- In some cases, the long-chain acyl group at the sn-1 position of glycerol is replaced by an alkyl or alk-1-enyl group. -!- In other cases, the diacylglycerol is replaced by ceramide. -!- The only characterized enzyme with this specificity is from Trypanosoma brucei, where the acyl groups are myristoyl, but the function of the trypanosome enzyme is unknown. -!- Substitution on O-2 of the inositol blocks action of this enzyme. -!- It is not identical with EC 3.1.4.50. -!- Formerly EC 3.1.4.47.

comment: -!- This enzyme catalyzes the third of three steps leading to the formation of siroheme from uroporphyrinogen III. -!- The first step involves the donation of two S-adenosyl-L-methionine- derived methyl groups to carbons 2 and 7 of uroporphyrinogen III to form precorrin-2 (EC 2.1.1.107) and the second step involves an NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenation to form sirohydrochlorin from precorrin-2 (EC 1.3.1.76). -!- In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the last two steps are carried out by a single bifunctional enzyme, Met8p. -!- In some bacteria, steps 1-3 are catalyzed by a single multifunctional protein called CysG, whereas in Bacillus megaterium, three separate enzymes carry out each of the steps, with SirB being responsible for the above reaction.

comment: -!- The enzyme from Bacillus sp. OxB-1 contains protoheme IX, the iron of which must be in the form Fe(2+) for activity. -!- (Z)-phenylacetaldoxime binds to ferric heme (the Fe(3+) form) via the oxygen atom whereas it binds to the active ferrous form via the nitrogen atom. -!- In this way, the oxidation state of the heme controls the coordination stucture of the substrate--heme complex, which regulates enzyme activity. -!- The enzyme is active toward several (Z)-arylacetaldoximes and (E/Z)- alkylaldoximes as well as toward arylalkylaldoximes such as 3-phenylpropionaldoxime and 4-phenylbutyraldoxime. -!- However, it is inactive with phenylacetaldoximes that have a substituent group at an alpha-site of an oxime group, for example, with (E/Z)-2-phenylpropionaldoxime and (E/Z)-mandelaldoxime. -!- The activity of the enzyme is inhibited completely by the heavy-metal cations Cu(+), Cu(2+), Ag(+) and Hg(+) whereas Fe(2+) and Sn(2+) have an activatory effect.

(HyuE) has a preference for hydantoins with aliphatic substituents, e.g. D- and L-5- (2-methylthioethyl)hydantoin, whereas that from Arthrobacter aurescens shows highest activity with arylalkyl substituents, especially 5-benzylhydantoin, at the 5-position. -!- In the enzyme from Sinorhizobium meliloti, Cys-76 is responsible for recognition and proton retrieval of D-isomers, while Cys-181 is responsible for L-isomer recognition and racemization.

comment: -!- Maximum activity is only obtained in the presence of alpha-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. -!- This bisphosphate is an intermediate in the reaction, being formed by transfer of a phosphate residue from the enzyme to the substrate, but the dissociation of bisphosphate from the enzyme complex is much slower than the overall isomerization. -!- Also, more slowly, catalyzes the interconversion of 1-phosphate and 6-phosphate isomers of many other alpha-D-hexoses, and the interconversion of alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate and 5-phosphate. -!- Formerly EC 2.7.5.1.

comment: -!- When this enzyme acts on tRNA(Asp), it catalyzes the same reaction as EC 6.1.1.12. -!- It has, however, diminished discrimination, so that it can also form aspartyl-tRNA(Asn). -!- This relaxation of specificity has been found to result from the absence of a loop in the tRNA that specifically recognizes the third position of the anticodon. -!- This accounts for the ability of this enzyme in, for example, Thermus thermophilus, to recognize both tRNA(Asp) (GUC anticodon) and tRNA(Asn) (GUU anticodon). -!- The aspartate-tRNA(Asn) is not used in protein synthesis until it is converted by EC 6.3.5.6 into asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn).

comment: -!- In some bacteria, a single protein catalyzes both this activity and that of EC 6.3.2.12, the combined activity of which leads to the formation of the coenzyme polyglutamated tetrahydropteroate (H(4)PteGlu(n)), i.e. various tetrahydrofolates (H(4)folate). -!- In contrast, the activities are located on separate proteins in most eukaryotes studied to date. -!- In Arabidopsis thaliana, this enzyme is present as distinct isoforms in the mitochondria, the cytosol and the chloroplast. -!- Each isoform is encoded by a separate gene, a situation that is unique among eukaryotes. -!- As the affinity of folate-dependent enzymes increases markedly with the number of glutamic residues, the tetrahydropteroyl polyglutamates are the preferred coenzymes of C(1) metabolism. -!- The enzymes from different sources (particularly eukaryotes versus prokaryotes) have different substrate specificities with regard to one-carbon substituents and the number of glutamate residues present on the tetrahydrofolates.
