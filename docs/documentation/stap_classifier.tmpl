<!-- component documentation -->
<p>
    This component uses the ss-rRNA Taxonomy Assigning Pipeline (STAP) to generate an automatic taxonomic 
    assignment for each of the input nucleotide sequences, which are assumed to be small subunit ribosomal 
    RNA (ss-rRNA) sequences.  If any of the input sequences do not appear to be ss-rRNA sequences then 
    STAP will detect and report this, so it is not necessary to prescreen the input.  STAP generates 
    taxonomic assignments by building phylogenetic trees from automatically-trimmed multiple sequence
    alignments.  A rough outline of the procedure that it uses is given below.
</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE INSTALLING STAP</h3>
<p>
<span style='font-weight: bold;'>
    As of this writing (August 2008), the Perl script that implements the STAP classifier, rRNA_pipeline_for_one.pl, 
    incorrectly returns a Unix exit code of 1 instead of 0 on successful completion.  In order to use 
    STAP with ergatis you <span style='font-weight:bold;'>MUST</span> patch the script to fix this 
    problem.</span>  This can be done by running the following Perl command, which patches the version of
    the script created by the STAP setup/install program:
</p>

    <div style='font-family: Courier,monospace;'>perl -pi.bak -e 's/exit 1/exit/;' rRNA_pipeline_for_one.pl</div>

<p>
    Note that there are two other 'exit;' commands in the script, which can be left unchanged as they 
    are only triggered in circumstances in which one can reasonably argue that the script has exited 
    normally, albeit without generating a taxonomic assignment for the input sequence.  We now return
    you to your regularly-scheduled ergatis component documentation.

<h3>algorithm</h3>

  See the paper referenced above for a more detailed and accurate description of the STAP algorithm.
  The following rough outline has been adapted from Figure 1 ("A flow chart of the STAP pipeline.") 
  in the paper:

    <ol>
     <li>Assign the input sequence to a domain (if not explicitly specified with <span style='font-weight: bold;'>$;DOMAIN$;</span> in ergatis)</li>
      <ol>
	<li>The input sequence is aligned to a special three-domain subset using CLUSTALW's profile alignment.</li>
	<li>Build a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree using phyml.</li>
        <li>Parse the output to determine the domain of the input sequence.</li>
      </ol>

     <li>Use BLASTN to find homologous sequences in the relevant STAP database (archaeal/bacterial or eukaryotic) based on the domain assignment</li>

     <li>Build tree #1
      <ol>
       <li>Align the input sequence to the precomputed alignments for the sequences identified in the previous step</li>
       <li>Automatically trim the alignment</li>
       <li>Build a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree using phyml (tree 1)</li>
      </ol>
     </li>

     <li>Make an initial taxonomic assignment via mid-point rooting</li>
     <li>Build a database of sequences that includes:
       <ul>
        <li>All database sequences 1 level up from the initial assignment (or 2 or more levels up if <span style='font-weight: bold;'>$;SECOND_TREE_STEP_UP$;</span> is used)</li>
	<li>2 outgroup sequences</li>
       </ul>
     </li>

     <li>Build tree #2
      <ol>
       <li>Align the input sequence to the precomputed alignments for the sequences identified in the previous step</li>
       <li>Automatically trim the alignment</li>
       <li>Build a tree using phyml (tree 1)</li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     
     <li>Make a final assignment using outgroup rooting</li>

    </ol>

<p>
    It is important to note that the results produced by STAP are only as good as the underlying ss-rRNA 
    databases, since the success of the procedure relies on correctly placing the input sequence(s) at the
    appropriate location in a phylogenetic tree that is composed solely of representatives from the STAP
    databases.  Currently STAP uses data from two ss-rRNA databases: <a href='http://greengenes.lbl.gov'>Greengenes</a>
    for bacterial and archaeal sequences and <a href='http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/'>RDP II</a> for eukaryotic sequences.
    Both of these sites/databases have their own SSU-rRNA classification tools.
</p>

<h3>input</h3>
<p>
    Like the program itself, this component accepts FASTA files as input.  If you have a single
    file containing multiple sequences in FASTA format, you should use the 
    <a href='./documentation.cgi?article=components&page=split_multifasta'>split_multifasta</a>
    component first to generate individual sequence files.
</p>

<h3>implemented options</h3>
<p>
   <ul>
    <li>-n: number of unclassified ss-rRNA nearest neighbors to ignore when building tree #1</li>
    <li>-t: number of levels to step up from the initial assignment when building tree #2</li>
    <li>-d: the domain of the input sequences (E=eukaryote, P=bacterial/archaeal)</li>
   </ul>
 Note that there is currently no way to specify a different domain (-d option) for different
 sequences in the input set; at present the option applies to all of the input sequences.
</p>

<h3>output</h3>
<p>
    Curently the component produces output in STAP's native format.  An example of the final
    .results file is shown below (artifically line-wrapped for readability).  See 
    <a href='http://128.120.136.15/mediawiki/index.php/STAP_download#Read_the_results'>the Eisen Lab.'s STAP wiki page</a>
