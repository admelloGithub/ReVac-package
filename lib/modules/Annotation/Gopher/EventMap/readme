The Annotation::Gopher::EventMap::FileReader module
was implemented to support a new requirement for the
extraction software (legacy2bsml.pl).

For the euk projects, a molecule name value should be
constructed using the clone Genbank accession + the 
genus species strain.

A Prism API method retrieves the genus species strain
information from the common..genomes.name field.

The clone Genbank accession value is not available in
the euk annotation database.   The accession is 
available in the GOPHER system.

A script is available for retrieving this accession 
and corresponding clone identifier and GOPHER event ID.

The script is invoked like this:
/usr/local/devel/ANNOTATION/Release/bin/events_display.pl -D esg2 -type WGS -map > gopherEventsMaps.txt


The Annotation::Gopher::EventMap::FileReader module knows
how to read, parse and validate the contents of the output
file.

A test program has been prepared for the module as well.

Sample invocation (and output) of the test driver is:

perl -I . Annotation/Gopher/EventMap/testFileReader.pl --infile Annotation/Gopher/EventMap/gopherEventsMaps.txt
Processed '2174' lines and read in '2173' records from file 'Annotation/Gopher/EventMap/gopherEventsMaps.txt'
Retrieved accession 'AAFB02000004' for event_id '1105170360677'
Retrieved accession 'AAFB02000004' for gopher_id '1104750507028'
