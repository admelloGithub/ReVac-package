=head1 NAME

collate_couns_by_phenotype.pl - given a file with a list of read count files
and a file with how filename prefixes in those files match to a replicate and phenotyp group,
this script will output a tab-delimeted file like this:
<replicate id> <phenotype> <read count file>

The file names in the read count files must be unique so that they can be matched to replicates 
using the information in the sample matching file.

  USAGE: collate_couns_by_phenotype.pl <read count list file> <sample matching file> <output file>
