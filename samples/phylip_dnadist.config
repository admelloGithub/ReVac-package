;; Path to a file containing aligned sequence data in the format accepted by dnadist, e.g.
;; 
;;    3   6
;; seq1      AACGTG
;; seq2      AGGGTC
;; seq3      CAGCCC
;;
;; The first number (3) is the number of sequences, the second (6) is the aligned sequence
;; length.  The id of each sequence must fit into 10 characters.  See the dnadist documentation
;; for more details..

[parameters]
;; Control file to pass to dnadist.  Note that the control file (which is simply a way to
;; specify noninteractive responses to the dnadist program's interactive menu) must not
;; include either: 1. an initial line setting the input file name, or 2. a "Y" on the final
;; line (used to tell dnadist to accept the inputs and start running.)  These initial and
;; final portions of the control file will be generated automatically by the component, and
;; a control file will be generated automatically if none is provided.  It is also highly
;; recommended that dnadist NOT be run with the option to print progress messages, since 
;; this can generate a significant amount of NFS traffic/IO activity.  By default the parallel
;; version of dnadist at IGS has this option disabled.
