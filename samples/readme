The restoredb workflow component is executed when we need to restore a
chado database from BCP files.

The workflow will execute the following atomic steps:

mkdir_compute_scratch
mkdir_revoke_permissions
mkdir_drop_tables
mkdir_create_tables
mkdir_partition_tables
mkdir_load_tables
mkdir_create_indices
mkdir_grant_permissions
revoke_permissions
drop_tables
create_tables
partition_tables
load_tables
create_indices
grant_permissions

The mkdir_* steps simply create directories for capturing the stdout, stderr
and log files produced when the main steps are executed.

revoke_permissions will read the appropriate DDL and execute statements that
will revoke all permissions on all chado tables to public.

drop_tables will read the appropriate DDL and execute statements that will
result in all tables being dropped.

create_tables will read the appropriate DDL and execute statements that will
result in the creation of all tables.

partition_tables will read the appropriate DDL and execute statements that will
result in the partitioning of select chado tables.

load_tables will result in the invocation of chadoloader.pl.  This script will
load the contents of the BCP files into the target chado database using the 
appropriate bulkcopy mechanisms available.

create_indices will read the appropriate DDL and execute statements that will
result in the creation of all indices and constraints for all chado tables.

grant_permissions will read the appropriate DDL and execute statements that
will grant all permissions on all chado tables to public.

One of the notable features of the restoredb workflow is that the particular
chado database/project can be changed to another chado version e.g. from
chado-v1r7b1 to chado-v1r8b1.  This is accomplished by setting the 
input workflow component variable $;CHADO_SCHEMA_VERSION$;.
Immediately following the execution of this workflow, the project's
sharedconf.ini should point to the CHADO_SCHEMA_VERSION directory.

To-do:
Workflow testing.  These steps have been executed as part of other workflow components.
PostgreSQL Prism API support for sql2Chado.pl and chadoloader.pl.
